### Blogs
1. [SpinMry's Lab](https://blog.spinmry.moe/)  
	High school student as he is, he has got great amount of knowledge on hardware, especially legacy workstations, PDAs , and calculators, and has a rich experience about bots. He, without doubt, is really good at algorithm and data structure. I present his blog at the top, with great **gratitude** because he is the person who lead me to think more about and get familiar with Linux.
