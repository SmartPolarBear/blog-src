## See Further
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the university, the courses,  complicated and difficult, provide more higher perspective in understanding and analyzing than challenges. I had ever tried to apply transformations on image with GDI+, where all the adjustments made, like changes in brightness or saturation, are expressed in what's called a transforming matrix. With few tools as a pupil, I, at that time, can only have a test on all the elements in that 5x5 matrix, or just copy codes and wish it could work, to provide certain features. But with the grab on linear algebra, now I can well understand how it works, and even more sophisticated designs like why it use a 5x5 matrix while only 4 channels of colors presented in the image. Through the tough journey of learning these abstract  stuff, I am equipped with enough tools to see further, and know things better at the very beginning of every project.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above all, I have made plans to read. It's may be strange for a engineering student to read about labor movement and things, but I deem it important. The ancestors, being remembered or forgot, right before the dawn of a better society, risk their life to push the society forward, to defend their human rights. Their courage, and their devotion are worth knowing and remembering. Moreover, though I have basic knowledge and practical experience on them, I try to read famous materials and books about networking, data structures and algorithms. I am determined to synthesize and systematize my knowledge about them.

## Getting Involved
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one should be the slave of tests and scores. I firmly believe that everyone is supposed to develop their abilities in all ways, which is why I, despite tight schedule and academic pressure, get involved in various kind of things. I participate in acquisition and processing department of  student union and have taken charge of some posts.
